# Instructions for adding new files

New files should live in a new folder. Each folder should have a Readme that describes what the files are and limitations. 
If the files come with an associated license, the license file should also be included in this folder.

This repo is for small files only (those [GitHub will allow](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github) you to push, limits are currently 25mb via browser, 100mb via command line).
Larger files can be put in S3 if you share them with the Cleanlab team.
