8533,But the price is nuts! At least with the print version I can clip articles pass it along and take to my library when I am done.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8534,I love my Kindle but Im not paying the same price as the print version,B00077B7M6,⭐⭐
8535,"This price is not just ridiculous it's offensive...  It's ""The Economist"", shouldn't they understand price points a little better than this?!?!",B00077B7M6,⭐
8536,forget about it. why would anyone in their right mind pay this price on kindle. what is the point of having kindle and saving paper..,B00077B7M6,⭐
8537,"This price is really stupid. I heard its probably amazon's fault, as they keep 70% of the subscription price. I love amazon, but this is going too far.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8538,Overpriced if you compair it with other electronic subscriptions. They will need to come down in price if they want to have more paperless (& distribution-less) customers.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8539,"Well, perhaps the The Economist audience was the wrong population of reader upon which to attempt extortion?",B00077B7M6,⭐
8540,"A print subscription is about the same, but includes full access to their superb web site.

Unless you don't have a fixed address, this one's a bad deal.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8541,"I would rather keep my printed subscription, sorry, trees, have to wait till they drop the price then I will start to save you.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8542,The Economist magazine needs to hire a good economist who can advice them on how to set a proper price for the Kindle version of the magazine.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8543,I would get it for half this price but Amazon has missed it with the pricing. I hope that Amazon will reconsider and make this more available.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8544,"You'd think of all rags available on the Kindle, this one would have the best pricing model. Not the worst.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8545,"who's seriosly going to pay more to get less.  Love the magazine, but I think you've lost your way on this one.  Very disappointed.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8546,"The Economist's content is and always has been great.  But an electronic edition that costs the same as the print is pure robbery.  Once it drops in price, I will subscribe.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8547,"It's a shame that the Economist, and probably to a lesser degree Amazon, are trying to gouge their customers after they've spent so much time and energy building goodwill.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8548,Much like my fellow readers I must express my disdain for the excessive pricing of this digital offering.,B00077B7M6,⭐⭐
8549,"I was so excited to see the Economist was on Kindle, yet at that price...waaay to much for a digital subscription.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8550,I love the Economist and am all for saving a few trees and getting the kindle version but the price needs to be lower than at the news stands - period.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8551,The price is absolutely ridiculous. I will continue to read the hard copy of the magazine and enjoy my 14-day trial through Kindle.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8552,"Who would pay this amount for an electronic version ??
I am just dissapointed.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8553,Much too expensive. If the price does not come down during the two week trial Iwill just cancel.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8554,I will place my order when the price is 1/2 the price of the printed version.,B00077B7M6,⭐⭐
8555,"I was looking forward to the Kindle version of the Economist, but this is too expensive for an electronic version.",B00077B7M6,⭐
8556,It's just too expensive. The print version is exactly the same price. If it were about 1/2 that I would buy it and I'm sure a lot of other people would too.,B00077B7M6,⭐
8557,"I've wanted this magazine for 6 months, and finally splurged and got it.

11298,"lots and lots of advertising in this magazine, super fun to get ideas from the clothes and photo shoots even if the clothes are way out of my budget",B000K0YFVU,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11299,"My daughter gets 17, and she enjoys its, but I like the Teen Vogue because it is a little less casual and a little classier.  With both publications, she is well balanced.",B000K0YFVU,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11300,I can't believe people will buy this for their teenage girls as young as 12 & 13 & every other coveron the magazine talks about sex.  No way my child will be reading this trash.,B000K0YFVU,⭐
11301,I have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed!,B000K0YFVU,⭐
11302,It must be VERY difficult to put a name on a list and put something in the mail.  I got two subscriptions via Amazon and neither has arrived yet.  Very frustrating.,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11303,This is one of the best magazines out there. The articles and advice are good. I really enjoy the jokes and the 10 Things You Don't Know About Women features every month.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11304,"Do not like the digital format and too many advertisements. I was a big fan of the printed magazine, wish it had better formating.",B000LXHJFK,⭐
11305,A good magazine. Unfortunately got worse since the editor changed,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11306,This magazine has become way too precious for my tastes. I miss the really gritty fiction and raunchy humor.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11307,"Overrated, too many ads. No reason to charge a subscription rate. Even the style sections should be rated as advertisements",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11308,Esquire Hearst Magazines,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐

11310,"Garbage. All ads, all unrealistic fashions. Liberal hit pieces on Trump.",B000LXHJFK,⭐

11312,"NOT WHAT IS USED TO BE.  MOSTLY FASHION ADS AND ARTICLES.  TRULY, A WASTE OF TIME.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐
11313,Meets expectations,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11314,The best magazine on the market,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
11315,Esquire has become far too left radical liberal for me to get any enjoyment from. Might as well read the ny times or cosmopolitan,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11316,Waste of time and paper.,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11317,I got this Subscription to Esquire for a super low price and it's a good magazine but not really necessary for my life.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11318,I use this in traffic.  If I get stuck in a snowstorm I'll read it. Normally it just sits by the fireplace.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11319,too much advertising,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11320,"This mag is losing it high quality of yesteryear. Trying to keep up with the trends of stoopid young people is just that, a trend, not longevity.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐

11324,"It was ok, not that great.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11325,Meh!  Hardly any real men in this magazine.  They have a way of even taking a tough guy and just making him look like sulking prissy guy.,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11326,Great magazine with great articles.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
11327,Excellent deal,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

11330,its been 3 months and I only got one issue,B000LXHJFK,⭐

11334,Bad format for kindle. Love the content still; no judgment on the magazine itself. I'll just buy the print copy.,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11335,Disappointed that it isn't full screen on my Fire HD. I typically have to zoom each page for comfortable reading,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐
11336,I've been getting these for a while now and rarely do I find anything interesting in them. I won't be renewing my subscription.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐

11339,"I haven't receive any issues yet, though I've been looking. What's up ?  You are getting a bit pushy and confusing  se ya",B000LXHJFK,⭐
11340,there was supposed to be an email to the recipient to indicate this was a gift  -  did not happen,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11341,the magazine has some good articles but really does not suit me but I am 74 years old and perhaps not interested in much of the advertising and articles.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11342,"There are some very good articles that make for an enjoyable read. Some are pretty in depth and provide an option to the daily news in newspapers, tv, etc.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐

11346,It occasionally has good articles like the one on Robert Redford this month. And I can't say you could beat the price.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11347,"Some pretty good articles, some good fashion, easy reading before bed time.  And for that price, who gives a darn.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11348,Looks like March will be the first issue I see.  I guess this is more of a review of the fulfillment process then the magazine but buyers should beware that patience is required.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11349,I ended up not reading it cause I found it hard to read on the kindle. I prefer good old magazines.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11350,Just received my first issue...earlier than expected...enjoy this magazine much!  I like reading issues from a man's point of view.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11351,there must be faster way to begin subscription - close to two months to recieve magazine subscription is not desirable to my taste.,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11352,"BY FAR, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANYTHING YET. JUST DON'T GET WHY IT TOOK SO LONG! SO I COULD NOT REALLY RATE IT!",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐
11353,I ordered the one year subscription (non auto-renewal).  I received four issues and then it stopped.  Okay...it was only eight bucks but this is bogus!,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11354,Didn't really read a single copy. They all went to the recycle bin after sitting in a pile for over a year. Would be a great mag if I had actually read them.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐
11355,I've always enjoyed the magazine but the company that made the offering over extended themselves and as a result I will be missing my first issue. Very disappointing.,B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐

is lots of gibberish with little insight into the human psyche.",B000LXHJFK,⭐
11360,"This magazine is either good or bad,no in betweens. Each issue is different. Way to much advertisement. I have been reading Esquire for years. Worth the price for subscription.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11361,Way too many ads.  Made it difficult to find articles.  Super heady cologne ads for men's fragrances stayed on hands and clothes.  Found one good article.,B000LXHJFK,⭐
11362,"Pretty interesting articles, and refreshing broad topics. Biggest complaint is lots of ad's, but then again its good for them as print magazines are struggling.",B000LXHJFK,⭐⭐⭐

11365,I agree that it is a shame that you cannot order previous issues from the kindle store.  I would think this somethimg that most readers want a loss of revenue for amazon.,B000N8V3FU,⭐
11366,My only complaint is: the Kindle version needs to improve the legibility of charts and diagrams.,B000N8V3FK,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11367,F*** Donald trup,B000N8V3FK,⭐
11368,They omit various sections - no real rhyme or reason - just poor quality control,B000N8V3FK,⭐⭐

11387,It was a bad surprise to me to read Times. I did not find interesting the materials and brought to me nothing new.,B000N8V3FK,⭐⭐
11388,Too much information to take on board every time.  I would enjoy it much more if I had more time and was less distracted by the demands of my work,B000N8V3FK,⭐⭐⭐⭐
11389,I compared this to ipad app and the physical magazine. Clumsy app and I found it difficult to navigate through the articles and know where I was.,B000N8V3FK,⭐⭐

12722,for me it is quite important to write only about something I know quite well. For some of NVATE authors obviously not. Mixing kW with kWh (power with energy) shouldn't happen.,B0058BJHLY,⭐⭐
